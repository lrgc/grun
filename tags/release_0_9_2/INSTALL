Basic install instructions

Should work for all GTK versions above 1.0.1,
tested on 1.0.6, 1.1.2, 1.1.7, 1.1.9, 1.1.11 and 1.1.14

Note: There was a memory allocation bug in GTK 1.1.6, this affected
all GTK apps. Upgrade to 1.1.7.
Note: In GTK 1.1.11, there is a small bug in the entry widget that
causes the first letter highlighted to be the wrong color. This has
been fixed in 1.1.13 and above.

Run the following to build grun

	./configure
	make
	make install

That should do it. Stick a menu item in your favourite WM for it
and launch away.

To use the console mode tester, append --enable-testfile to the
configure command line, and to change the xterm executable name,
add --with-default-xterm=xterm as well.

To use the file associations, append --enable-associations to the
configure commmand line.
