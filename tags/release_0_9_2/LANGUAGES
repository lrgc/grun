Supported languages - English, Canadian French, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portugese

Changed from my own version of i18n to using gettext to do it for me. I have ported
the headers over to .po files for the languages I have. If you find that your
language is missing, which probably will be the case for the first couple of releases
as I only speak English, please write a .po file for it.

To do this, copy the file messages.po to xx.po where xx is your 2 character country
code. Then translate the msgid strings and place them in the msgstr strings. Look at
one of the other .po files for more details.

Please don't flame me if your language isn't present, I'm no polyglot and only
speak English. And C.

Thank you
