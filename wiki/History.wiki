#summary The history of the project

= The past =

gRun was originaly written by Bruce Smith, and ported to Win32 by Troy Engel. The first recorded release was 0.3, from October 19th, 1997. I suppose there was a different name back then, since the changelog entry from November 26th, 1998 records the change from Motif to Gtk.

Bruce kept updating and releasing until February 4h, 1999, the date of his last release, 0.9.2.

From then, the project was basicaly taken over by the maintainers of the Debian package. Apart from extensive bug fixing, they are responsible for porting the package to Gtk2.
Most special kudos to Oohara Yuuma, who was responsible for the package from 2002 onwards.

All these details were gleamed from the changelog files. If you know more about the history of this software, please do tell!
